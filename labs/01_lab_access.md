## Lab 1 - Lab access and connectivity validation

### Task 1

This lab validates access to your POD over SSH and RDP

##### Step 1

From your laptop, use an SSH client such as `putty` or `secureCRT` to log into the public IP of your jump host as provided by your instructor. Use the username and password provided by your instructor.


##### Step 2 

From your laptop, use an RDP client to log into the public IP of your jumphost as provided by your instructor. Use the username and password provided by your instructor.



### NOTE:

- The jumphost is a `Ubuntu` host. Most of the exercises will be focused on using a CentOS VM, to reflect the popularity of RedHat based servers in the enterprise ecosystem.

- The CentOS VM can be accessed from the Ubuntu host by typing `ssh centos`, after logging in. The same credentials will be used on both servers.
