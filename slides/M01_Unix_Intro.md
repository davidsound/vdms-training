# A brief history of Linux



    Hello everybody out there using minix â€“

    Iâ€™m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, wonâ€™t be big and
    professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
    since april, and is starting to get ready. Iâ€™d like any feedback on
    things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
    (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
    among other things).

    Iâ€™ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
    This implies that Iâ€™ll get something practical within a few months, and
    Iâ€™d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions
    are welcome, but I wonâ€™t promise Iâ€™ll implement them ðŸ™‚

    Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)

    PS. Yes â€“ itâ€™s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
    It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
    will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as thatâ€™s all I have :-(.

# Which Shell?


There are a number of different shells for Unix. People can become very attached to the shell they prefer. Popular shells include

```
sh - the bourne shell
bash - the bourne again shell
csh - the c shell
ksh - the Korn shell (strangely, not named for the band)
zsh - the z shell

```


In this course, we will be working on the `bash` shell

# Directory Listing


Because memory and CPU power were at a premium in the past, UNICS (eventually shortened to UNIX) used short commands to minimize the space needed to store them and the time needed to decode them - hence the tradition of short UNIX commands we use today, e.g. ls, cp, rm, mv etc.


- List contents of the directory:

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ ls
configs  VirtualBoxVMs
[ntc@ntc ~]$ 

```


- The Present Working Directory `pwd`

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ pwd
/home/ntc
[ntc@ntc ~]$
```

# Navigation

- By default opens in "normal mode"
- `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` keys are used to move the cursor left, up, down and right 
- Arrow keys will also work but discouraged.


In the normal mode:

```
w : moves the cursor forward one word at a time
b:  moves the cursor backward one word at a time
$:  moves the cursor to the end of the line
^:  moves the cursor to the first character of the line
SHIFT-g: moves the cursor to the bottom of the page
```


---

class: ubuntu

# Exiting vim

1. Type the `ESC` key. This will tell the editor that the context is being changed. 

2. Now type the `:` key. Now your cursor will be blinking at the bottom of the file.

3.  Type the `q` or `q!`(force) keys to exit the file. 


_`vim` has been subjected to ( an unfairly) number of jokes about leaving users stranded after opening a file._

# Enabling line numbers

1. Type the `ESC` key. This will tell the editor that the context is being changed. 

2. Now type the `:` key. Now your cursor will be blinking at the bottom of the file.

3. Type `se nu`; short for "set numbers" to enable line numbers.


**To go to a particular line you can simply type the line number after steps 1 and 2**

# Editing text

- From normal mode, use the `i` key to enter the `INSERT` mode. In this mode you can edit text by simply typing the keys.

- To delete a character:
    1. Exit the `INSERT` mode by pressing the `ESC` key. 
    2. Navigate to the character 
    3. Use the `x` key to delete it
    
- To undo an edit, from the `normal` mode, type the `u` key. Similarly, to `redo` an edit, use the `CTRL-r` key combination

- To replace an entire word, navigate to the start of the word (or position from which you would like to make the change) and then type `cw` for "Change Word". This will switch the editor automatically to the `INSERT` mode


**From normal mode, type `ESC-:` and then `w` to save or "write" a file. If creating a new file use `w` followed by the new file's name.**

# INSERT mode

---

# Finding and replacing text

- From normal mode, use the `/` key to invoke a search followed by the text to find
- To look for repeated occurrences, type the `n` key for "next match"

To find and replace use the following steps:
1. From normal mode, type `ESC-:` followed by:
2.  `%s/` *[Word to replace]* `/` *[replacement word]* `/g`

> The `/g` implies "make the replacements globally for all matches in the file"

class: ubuntu

# Opening multiple files in split screens

- Use `sp` for horizontal split or `vsp` for vertical

<img src="slides/media/vim/vim4.png" alt="Pep8" style="align: right:;width:800px;height:350px;">

```
Use `CTRL-ww` to jump between the split

```


---

# Copying, cutting and pasting

- To copy a line from normal mode, navigate to the line and type `yy` or "yank"
- To copy multiple lines, go to the starting line and then prepend `yy` with the number of lines to yank. For instance, `3yy` will yank or copy 3 lines.
- To cut, use the same methodology as copy. Except use the `dd` key combination rather than `yy`
- In either case, to paste the line copied, navigate to the desired location and then use the `p` key.

# Using plugins and plugin managers (vim-plug)

- A Vim plugin is a set of Vimscript files that are laid out in a certain directory structure. Before plugin managers became popular, Vim plugins were usually distributed as tarballs. Users would manually download the file and extract it in a single directory called `~/.vim`, and Vim would load the files under the directory during startup.

- Installing the `vim-plug` plugin manager is as simple as downloading it:


```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```


---

## Installing plugins with vim-plug - Step 1

The list of plugins to be installed are added to `.vimrc` within the `plug#begin()` and `plug#end()` calls

<img src="slides/media/vim/vim6.png" alt="Pep8" style="align: middle:;width:800px;height:450px;">

---

## Installing plugins with vim-plug - Step 2

Type `ESC-:source .vimrc` to invoke the `.vimrc` file. (This is equivalent to stopping vim and restarting it)

<img src="slides/media/vim/vim7.png" alt="Pep8" style="align: middle:;width:800px;height:450px;">


---
## Installing plugins with vim-plug - Step 3

From normal mode `InstallPlug` is invoked to install the declared plugins.

# TABs vs SPACEs

[Silicon_valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI)


- Extremely important for "indentation sensitive" tools like `YAML` and `Python`
- Hard to tell visually whether whitespace is a `TAB` or a `SPACE`


---
class: ubuntu

# TABs vs SPACEs (Contd.)

In normal mode, `set list` . This is a boolean operator that turns-on or off whitespace identifiers. (Default off)


```
`:set list` displays whitespace, while `:set nolist` displays normally

```

- Optionally use `set listchars` to specify how to display TABs


- By default TABs are identified as `^I` characters.

# CyberDuck and Sublime Text 

---

# CyberDuck

- Linux supports many GUI based editors. However oftentimes, especially when working with remote servers, the "Window Manager" is not installed. 

- CyberDuck is an Open Source, free software that can be used to manage remote files while still using a GUI editor locally.

- It relies on SFTP along with other protocols to edit files remotely



---

# CyberDuck(Contd.)

The 3 main functions provided by the tool are :

1. Download from remote host
2. Upload to remote host (upload on changes)
3. Delete on remote host

These options are made available through a command line tool called `duck`

---

class: ubuntu

# Download

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ duck --verbose --download sftp://ntc@centos/home/ntc/configs/ ~/
```

---
class: ubuntu

# Upload

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ duck --verbose --existing compare --upload sftp://ntc@centos/home/ntc/configs/ ~/configs/
```

-  The `existing compare` option, instructs duck that if any of the files in our local configs directory exist in the remote configs directory they should be compared for changes. 
-  If the files have been changed locally, then upload the changed files. If no changes have been made, skip.



---
class: ubuntu

# Delete

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ duck --verbose --delete sftp://ntc@centos/home/ntc/configs/test.file
```

This will delete the file on the remote host.


---
# Sublime Text

- Sublime Text is a very popular multi-platform editor. It comes with a lot of default features (like colorization, alignment, indentation etc.) that requires manual installation of plugins with an editor like `vim`
- Users are comfortable using the mouse to navigate and remembering all the keystrokes of a CLI based editor like `vim` might be a steep learning curve


*Sublime Text is not free*

- By default when a new user is added, a group by the same name is created and the user is added to that group

```
# Adding a new group

[ntc@ntc ~]$ sudo groupadd ntc-netops
[sudo] password for ntc: 
[ntc@ntc ~]$
```

The groups command can be used to check the current groups a user is member off:

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ groups ntc-netops-user1
ntc-netops-user1 : ntc-netops-user1
[ntc@ntc ~]$
```

# The usermod command

The `usermod` command can be used to update group memberships of an existing user:

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ sudo usermod -a -G ntc-netops ntc-netops-user1 
[ntc@ntc ~]$
```

# File permissions

Every file in Unix has the following attributes:

- Owner permissions âˆ’ The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.

- Group permissions âˆ’ The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.

- Other (world) permissions âˆ’ The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

The actions typically are Read(r), Write(w) and eXecute(x).


`chmod` to change these permissions

```
[ntc-netops-user1@ntc ~]$ chmod o-r /opt/ntc-netops/Ops_workflow.md 
[ntc-netops-user1@ntc ~]$ 
[ntc-netops-user1@ntc ~]$ ls -l /opt/ntc-netops/

# Modifying the PATH

The `$PATH` variable determines the search path for executables

Use the `which` command to find the current path of a given binary:

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ which python
/bin/python
[ntc@ntc ~]$
```

Update the path using `export`

```
[ntc@ntc ~]$ mkdir mybin
[ntc@ntc ~]$ 
[ntc@ntc ~]$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mybin/
[ntc@ntc ~]$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/ntc/.local/bin:/home/ntc/bin:./mybin/:/home/ntc/mybin/
[ntc@ntc ~]$

# The SSH `config` file

Used to store SSH specific configuration:

```
Host bastion.ntc.com
  Hostname proxy.ntc.com
  User ntc
  ForwardAgent yes
```

Here we created an alias for proxy.ntc.com as bastion.ntc.com 

Unlike other aliases, this only impacts SSH. It also enables us to adjust ssh parameters on a per-host basis

# SSH Proxying

SSH supports a `ProxyCommand` option to bounce through an intermediate host

```
ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p bastion.ntc.com" veos1


```

Add this to the `~/.ssh/config` file
```
Host veostest
  Hostname eos-spine1
  User ntc
  ForwardAgent yes
  ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastion.ntc.com veos1
```


```
[ntc@ntc .ssh]$ ssh veostest
